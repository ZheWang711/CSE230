### Lists

* A string is a list of characters
* Elements should be same type
* Lists can contain lists, can be different length but cannot be different types
* Operators:
    * `++` for concatenate (putting 2 lists together)
    * `:` for adding a element in the front of a list
        * `[1,2,3]` is actually `1:2:3:[]`
    * `!!` for indexing
* Can be compared if the elements can be compared, in **lexicographical order**
